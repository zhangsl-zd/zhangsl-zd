* Phytium I2S controller

The I2S bus (Inter-IC sound bus) is a serial link for digital
audio data transfer between devices in the system.

Required properties:

- compatible: should be "phytium,i2s"
- reg: It contains two register region:
       - first is for physical base address and length of I2S controller.
       - second is for physical base address and length of DMA_BDL controller.
- interrupts: should contain the DMA_BDL interrupt.
- clocks: phandle to clock provider with the clock number in the second cell
- dai-name: it will set dai's name used in driver.

Example for E2000 I2S controller:

i2s@28009000 {
	compatible = "phytium,i2s";
	reg = <0x0 0x28009000 0x0 0x1000>, <0x0 0x28005000 0x0 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 77 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&sysclk_600mhz>;
	dai-name = "phytium-i2s-lsd";
};
